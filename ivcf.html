                <h2>Redesigning the Experience</h2>
                <h3>Web and UI/UX Design for <a href="https://ivcf.ca">InterVarsity Canada</a></h3>

                <p><a href="https://ivcf.ca">InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Canada</a> is a non-denominational
                    Christian non-profit organization that focuses on work for youths and young adults. They have 9
                    summer camps and staff on university and college campuses to help guide youths in their journey of
                    faith. As a Web Developer at IVCF (InterVarsity Christian Fellowship), I reorganized the already
                    existing website content in a way that makes sense for both insiders and first-time visitors.</p>


                <!--1. Summer Camp Calendar-->
                <h4>1. Usability Test for the New Calendar</h4>
                <p>IVCF has 9 summer camps, and all of them were hearing from parents who are keen to send their kids to
                    camp say that the dates and rates are hard to find on their websites.</p>

                <p>One problem is that all of IVCF's summer camp websites are currently using tables, which is outdated
                    in web development standards, for the dates and rates information. Hence, no compatibility with
                    mobile devices. And in effort to get to the core of other problems, I was able to conduct a rather
                    simple usability test, which is to give three or more tasks to parents who are not very familiar
                    with our websites and observe them.</p>

                <p>Rates, or price, was one of the most crucial piece that parents look for that isn't explicitly
                    highlighted on IVCF's camp websites. And there were insurmountable amount of content to scroll
                    through, that the participants were overwhelmed and distracted by the quantity, especially on mobile
                    devices.</p>

                <img src="images/summer-calendar.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the previous summer camp calendar">

                <p>To tackle the almost infinite scrolling and inconspicuous price, pricing table was used instead of
                    the outdated table.</p>

                <img src="images/summer-calendar-present.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the current summer camp calendar">

                <p>Using the pricing table was the perfect solution to reduce the amount of scrolling and highlight the
                    price that most parents prioritize.</p>

                <img src="images/summer-calendar-mobile.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the previous summer camp calendar"
                    style="display: inline-block; width: 300px;">
                <img src="images/summer-calendar-mobile-present.jpg"
                    alt="a screenshot of the current summer camp calendar" style="display: inline-block; width: 332px;">

                <p>Much more condensed and simple accordion was used for mobile devices, which also greatly decreased
                    the time spent scrolling and brought the price and date to attention.</p>


                <!--2. Find a-->
                <h4>2. <a href="https://ivcf.ca/connectoncampus">Find a Campus,</a> <a
                        href="https://ivcf.ca/missions/find-a-mission">Find a Mission</a>, <a
                        href="https://ivcf.ca/camp/find-a-camp">Find a Camp</a></h4>
                <p>The purpose of the three pages on <a href="https://ivcf.ca">IVCF's main website</a> - Find a Campus,
                    Find a Mission and Find a Camp - is to help people find a campus/mission/camp that is nearest to
                    them. IVCF was using a map on the aforementioned pages to display all locations, which was not
                    helpful for a few reasons; first, there were a surplus of locations to look through both on the map
                    and the list below the map. Second, a map is hard to navigate on mobile devices unless it is an
                    application like Google Maps.</p>

                <img src="images/find-a-mission.jpg" alt="a screenshot of a past Find a Mission page">

                <p>Although the objective of all three pages are the same, each had to be taken with a different
                    approach. Find a Campus page didn't need any supplementary information except some introductory
                    content and links to pages for campuses that are connected to IVCF. It was critical for Find a
                    Mission page to have fundraising amount, date, location, contact information and the link to apply.
                    Find a Camp page only needed basic contact information for each camp.</p>

                <img src="images/find-a-campus.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the current Find a Campus page">
                <p>After avid research, <a href="https://ivcf.ca/connectoncampus/">Find a Campus page</a> was stripped
                    of the map and had lists of campuses organized by provinces in Canada. This was much more effective
                    for students, since they know which province their campuses are in. Moreover, scrolling through
                    campus lists was much less work on mobile devices compared to using a map. All links are underlined
                    to explicitly indicate that they are links.</p>

                <p><a href="https://ivcf.ca/camp/find-a-camp/">Find a Camp</a> became a simple page with contact
                    information for each camp organized by province. And <a
                        href="https://ivcf.ca/missions/find-a-mission/">Find a Mission</a> also has a new layout that
                    highlights date, location, fundraising amount and contact information instead of a map.</p>


                <!--3. iDonate Persona Exercises-->
                <h4>3. UX Exercise for the <a href="https://ivcf.ca/donate/">New Donation Platform</a></h4>
                <p>Due to the lack of responsive design support and usability issues with their previous donation
                    system, IVCF decided to implement a new donation platform; they were looking for the best way to do
                    it while keeping the users in mind. I lead the team to gather data and create personas, in order to
                    prevent from off-tracking with our own assumptions of what users would want.</p>

                <p>We found out that when users navigate to the donation page, they go to it knowing what they're next
                    step is going to be exactly, which is to donate. Thus, we decided to strip down any introductory
                    information about the organization from the first section they will see as soon as they land on the
                    page.</p>

                <p>As an organization that aims at youth, it was important to keep the page not only functional, but
                    also visually attracting. One of the branding elements that InterVarsity uses is a paint brush
                    effect, which is in line with the boldness and vibrant youths. As a team, we made the decision to
                    implement this effect on the page as well.</p>

                <img src="images/donation-platform.jpg">
                <p>The page is designed with the consideration of users' gaze pattern. We kept the Z-pattern in mind;
                    when someone lands on the page, the first thing they would notice is the logo; through this, they
                    recognize the identity of the page. And they look right, where a link that takes them to the U.S.
                    site lives. If irrelevant, they will look left again, where the text to further convince them to
                    take action is. And the next thing a user will look to would be the donation form, where they can
                    fulfill their objective, ever more convinced.</p>

                <p>The embed form we used is made by <a href="https://idonate.com/">iDonate</a>.</p>
