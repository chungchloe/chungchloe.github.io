                <!--New Hope-->
                <h4>New Hope Fellowship Downtown</h4>
                <p>As a media team volunteer at <a href="https://newhopefellowship.ca/">New Hope Fellowship</a>, the
                    English ministry of the parent church Light Presbyterian Church, I had an opportunity to make a few
                    motion graphics to convey the missions of the creative team, to promote overseas missions and more.
                </p>
                <p>To mark a video made for New Hope Fellowship as their own, I animated their already existing logo.
                    This was used either at the beginning or the end of a video.</p>

                <video poster="images/nhf.jpg" playsinline="true" autoplay muted loop
                    src="images/nhf.mp4">
                    <source src="images/nhf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

                <p>To let the members of the church know that there will be overseas missions opportunities, I was asked
                    to make an effective animation in order to convey the message well.</p>

                <iframe width="862" height="485" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJAtvtb-nok" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p>New Hope Fellowship wanted their own creative team to understand what the objective is for the
                    creative ministry. I was asked to make the animation that matches the voice-over with clear and
                    impactful visuals.</p>

                <iframe width="754" height="424" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sp5ofbZdFdI" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

                <!--Automotive UI-->
                <h4>Automotive UI</h4>
                <p>Implementations of augmented reality in cars have been proposed and suggested in all good intentions
                    to improve our lives such as smart car windows. But have there been any for emergency vehicles,
                    which is actually so close in touch with human lives?</p>

                <p>A group of alumni including myself, and two professors at <a href="https://www.humber.ca/">Humber
                        College</a> decided to put together an interactive demo representing two head-up displays for
                    emeregency vehicles. And we researched how augmented reality could be implemented in emergency
                    situations.</p>

                <p>The video below is the head-up display for a paramedic who is next to the driver's seat (in this
                    case, we are assuming that there will always be a paramedic sitting next to the driver). They will
                    be able to receive a video feed from a bystander who is near the scene, and the video would be
                    scanned to analyze the patient and prepare the paramedics as to how to treat the patient.</p>

                <iframe width="766" height="479" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYTS7kznq1U" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p>Once the paramedics have treated the patient, the dahsboard, which is shown in the video below, will
                    guide them to the nearest hospital that will provide relevant care.</p>

                <video poster="images/automotive.jpg" playsinline="true" autoplay muted loop
                    src="images/automotive.mp4">
                    <source src="images/automotive.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

                <p>My role in this project was to create a seamless animation to reflect how the AR implementation on an
                    ambulance would work. Our work was selected and presented in the 10th <a
                        href="https://www.auto-ui.org">Automotive User Interface Conference</a> which took place in
                    Toronto, Ontario.</p>

                <!--Weathery-->
                <h4>Weathery</h4>
                <p>Weathery is a smartwatch interface design done as a personal project.</p>

                <p>It is easy to forget what temperature, or what kind of weather it was supposed to be today. Weathery,
                    the weather watch interface will never let you walk in the snow with your new pair of shoes on.</p>

                <!--Video-->
                <video poster="images/weathery.jpg" playsinline="true" autoplay muted loop
                    src="images/weathery-full.mp4">
                    <source src="images/weathery-full.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

                <p>Having numbers can help, but it is not as efficient as the visuals. Weathery shows you the current
                    weather, and the weather in the near future on your watch screen.</p>

                <!--Video-->
                <video poster="images/weathery.jpg" playsinline="true" autoplay muted loop
                    src="images/weathery-temp.mp4">
                    <source src="images/weathery-temp.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

                <p>But of course, numbers do matter. You never know if it is going to be extremely cold under a sunny
                    sky. On Weathery, you can just tap on the screen to see the temperature and the date.</p>
